## Description
DJ Duckalot is touring the world and playing at various clubs from Ibiza to Berlin to Tulum. But the later it gets, the crazier the crowd goes. it can happen that some throw things at the DJ. Some things to show appreciation and other things when they want him to play "something better". It can be everything from beer glasses, drinks, cocktails to CDs and roses and pen drives. If DJ Duckalot manages to duck the bad ones, he is safe, but if he gets hit, he will loose 10 points. If he catches a rose or a CD from the crowd, then he will gain 10 points. Once he reaches 0 he will loose the game.
